<p title="Who?">
Hi, my name is Halyna. I am taking IT1150 class and really excited about it. </p><br>
<p title="Why?">
I am hoping to better understand of how webpages are being built and learn about different elements and attributes.</p><br>
<p title="When?">
I like creating new things, why not try creating a new webpage. Perhaps, becoming a freelancer?</p><br>
<p title="Where?">
After I graduate from college, I am planning to continue my education at the university.</p><br>
<p title="WOW!">
My dream is to work remotely and being able to travel anywhere. And of course to hug a real panda, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda">something like this.</a></p>
