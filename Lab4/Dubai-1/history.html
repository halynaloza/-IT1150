                    <p>Dubai is famously known as the entertainment capital of the Middle East which attracts many party lovers from all over the world, especially those who are wealthy enough to splurge on the most expensive places in the city. While Dubai has cultivated this image for its tourists, it still discourages its Islamic nationals to indulge in many of the entertainment services offered. Hence, these services are often located in the more touristy areas rather than in residential parts.</p>
                    <p>Dubai is a city of skyscrapers, ports, and beaches, where big business takes place alongside sun-seeking tourism. Because of its large expatriate population, it feels like a Middle Eastern melting pot, and the atmosphere is generally tolerant. Religious affiliations are not a prominent aspect of city life. Islam is the majority religion, but churches and Hindu temples coexist with Dubai’s mosques.</p>

            <h3 class="fw-bold text-primary">Religion</h3>
            <p>Dubai, like the rest of the UAE is an Islamic Emirate and once in the city you are surrounded by many mosques and the call of prayer will be heard frequently. The most religious time of the year in Dubai is the Holy Month of Ramadan, which lasts for approximately 30 days. This is when Muslims fast during daylight hours to fulfil their duties to the fourth pillar of Islam. Tourists must be aware that during this period, eating, drinking and smoking is not permitted in public during the day, although some restaurants blackout their windows to allow people to consume food and beverages in private. Bars will not serve alcohol before 7.00pm and nightclubs are shut as no loud music is allowed.</p>
            <p>However, the UAE is tolerant and welcoming to foreigners who do not practice Islam. The government follows a policy of tolerance towards non-Muslims and Polytheist and in practice, interferes very little with their religious activities. The huge Arab population in Dubai includes many from Middle-Eastern countries which follow the Christian faith and non-Muslim expatriates. They are freely allowed to practice their own religion as long as they do not publicly distribute literature. In fact, Dubai has other religious places of worship, such as churches, gurdwaras and temples. The Meena Bazaar area of the city has both a Shiva and Krishna temple. Both are believed to be sanctioned by the late ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum. There is an electric crematorium run by a group of Indian expatriates. Furthermore, in early 2001, the ground was broken for the construction of several additional churches on a parcel of land in Jebel Ali donated by the government of Dubai for four Protestant congregations and a Catholic congregation. Construction of the first Greek Orthodox Church in Dubai (to be called St. Mary's) was completed in November 2009 with the help of General Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai Crown Prince and UAE Defence Minister, who donated a plot of land in Jebel Ali.</p>
